1.  **Developing a Courier App with GatsbyJS.**

    Using React, GraphQl and Node.js.

1.  **Try the app.**

    Navigate into the appâ€™s directory and start it up.

    (You might need the Gatsby CLI)
    cd courier-app/
    npm install
    gatsby develop or npm run develop.
    ```
    Visit `http://localhost:8000`.
    
    You are up and running
    
    You can also find it at https://london-courier.netlify.app/ but this is the master branch and we probably didn't implement our latest work.
